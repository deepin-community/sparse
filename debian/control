Suggests: sparse-test-inspect
Description: semantic parser of source files
 Sparse, the semantic parser, provides a compiler frontend capable of
 parsing most of ANSI C as well as many GCC extensions, and a collection
 of sample compiler backends, including a static analyzer also called
 "sparse". Sparse provides a set of annotations designed to convey
 semantic information about types, such as what address space pointers
 point to, or what locks a function acquires or releases.
 .
 Sparse can be invoked directly as "sparse" or via the "cgcc" wrapper
 around the C compiler.
